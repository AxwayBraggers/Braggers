### <a name="head1"></a> 1. DESCRIPTION
This repository holds the master project for the Axway Braggers project. The project aims at providing a common interface that interacts with third party blogging and forum APIs.
In this repo resides an Arrow App, which serves the project UI, and incorporates Data persistence.
*All 3rd party APIs* are represented as Arrow Connectors, which reside in their own repo-s. On project build, these connectors are cloned to the connectors folder, after that the code is published on Arrow Cloud.
The project is going to use a dev container on Arrow Cloud, meaning - it will automatically be **hibernated on 1hr of inactivity**. 

### <a name="head2"></a> 2. PROJECT OVERVIEW
The general concept of the Axway Braggers project is to de-couple all components in their individual repos. Meaning that each and every part of the project is going to have their own repo. 
Every member can work on every repo or strictly work on one repo (a matter of taste). Members can combine effort on tasks, they find difficult or time consuming.
Each repository will have a default structure, plus project guidelines. It's up to the [Axway Baggers](https://github.com/AxwayBraggers) members to decide the project implementation.
Individual projects are going to be cloned to the master project on project build.

#### 2.1. Aggregating user data

User data is going to be fetched from slack chat + github user data.

#### 2.2. Third party software connectors

Arrow connectors that connect to an API and implement CRUD methods.

 - **Wordpress.com** - connector
 - **Stackoverflow.com** - connector
 - **...**

The above listed connectors, are a minimum requirement for the project. Full crud functionality should be implemented for these connectors, and **functionality should be ensured** (tested).
After meeting those requirements, other connectors can be developed!

#### 2.3. Frontend - UI
The UI will be developed with the help of REACT. The framework is going to be build with the help of webpack. Generated scripts are going to be cloned inside the Master project.
The UI is going to use data provided by the connectors, to display information to the end user.
Login and authentication are going to be displayed, but the process is directed trough the "*github*" module.

### 3.  <a name="head3"></a> STRUCTURE

#### 3.1. Axway Braggers project structure

#### 3.2. Main project folder structure

The folder structure is a common one for an Arrow application:

 - **models** - the place where Arrow models are stored
 - **apis** - the place where Arrow APIs are stored
 - **conf** - project configurations 
 - **web/routes** - routes defined for the application
 - **web/views** - views rendered by the above routes
 - **web/public** - public folder served by arrow
 - **scripts** - folder that contains all shell scripts used for the project
 - **Resources** - external resources

### <a name="head4"></a>4. WORK PROCESS AND WORKFLOW

Since every project has their own repo, the work process is going to be decoupled.
Every member can fork a repo and work on it. Changes should be made to the `development` branch of that particular repo. After finalizing changes, members can initiate a `pull request` to the upstream repo (the one you forked) .
To start work on something, a member should be assigned to an issue in the issue tracker for the project. When making a pull request, the issue id should be supplied to the title of the **PR**  - having an issue with ID xxx14 - would become a PR title of - "*[xxx14] working on a change*".
If an issue does not exist for a particular case a member can create a new one, assign themselves to it and start working...

### <a name="head5"></a>5. BUILDING AND PUBLISHING

All "sub" projects are going to be cloned to the master project. This is achieved trough a /scripts/build_dev.sh script. Which clones projects in the node_modules/connectors folder.
The script also copies all static files generated by the UI project to the we/public folder of the project.
Publishing process is pretty straight forward. Once the desired functionality and structure are achieved and the app is working, calling ```appc publish``` from a terminal, will publish the app to the appcelerator's cloud.
